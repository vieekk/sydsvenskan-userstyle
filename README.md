Finally!

If you are a Swede and a southerner, you might enjoy reading [sydsvenskan.se](http://www.sydsvenskan.se/) from time to time, or maybe you just like to look at pictures of Malm√∂.

Either way you are most certainly enraged by the lack of symmetry on your widescreen monitor, and the ads, and the paywalls. This CSS override fixes this unacceptable behaviour. Use with Stylish!
